# Classification of Human Movements in Time Series Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
This project evaluates the performance of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for human movement classification in the UCF50 dataset. 

## Introduction
Human movements consist of actions that cannot be properly classified by one image alone, but rather by a set of images in a specific sequence. In this context, the goal of this project is to address the problem of identifying movements by using multi-frame containers (videos) and a time-series neural network. To achieve this goal,  a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture was chosen due to its ability to retain information from previous steps. 

Regarding the dataset, this study utilizes Realistic Action Recognition: UCF50 [1]. The main reasons for this choice are: the variety of human movement and consistency in usage worldwide.
