# Classification of Human Movements in Time Series Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
This project evaluates the performance of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for human movement classification in the UCF50 dataset. 

## Introduction
Human movements consist of actions that might not be classified properly just by one image. In this context, the main objective of ....
